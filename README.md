# FER
        Implemented DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) approach for classifying the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) dataset using VGG13 as the base architecture. 
        This approach was based on a research paper by Microsoft Research for the FER+ dataset. 
        The results obtained were further enhanced by applying Sobel and Laplacian filter to the images to detect edges and feeding it into the model. 
        This work was done as a part of my research internship at IISC. Bangalore.
